Package: dynare-matlab
Description-md5: 90e8fcabb135fcf60e09f0be51774946
Description-en: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them using
 the existing MATLAB installation.

Description-en: dedicated server for Enemy Territory: Quake Wars
 This package contains a launcher script and systemd unit to run a
 Enemy Territory: Quake Wars server using the proprietary
 x86 binaries provided by id Software.
 .
 Please note that the ETQW engine is not Free Software, and Debian
 cannot fix any bugs or security flaws in the engine or game code.
 .
 To mitigate any security flaws that might exist in this server,
 the systemd unit is not enabled by default, and must be enabled
 with systemctl if it should start at boot time. The systemd unit
 uses various security hardening options to prevent the server from
 escalating its privileges. There is no sysvinit script,
 since sysvinit does not provide similar security hardening.
 .
 To make this package useful, you will need to create and install some
 non-distributable packages by using the game-data-packager package:
 etqw-bin, and etqw-data.
 Creating those packages requires data files from an "Enemy Territory:
 Quake Wars" installation or DVD.

Description-en: Installer for game data files
 Various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
 and data. Often the engine and data are licensed in
 different ways, such that the engine can be distributed
 in Debian but the data cannot.
 .
 game-data-packager is a tool which builds .deb files for game
 data which cannot be distributed in Debian (such as
 commercial game data).
 .
 At the moment, game-data-packager has support for building .deb
 files for:

 otherwise, these docs have to phone home in order for any of the javascript

 Also, since Google is often blocked in China, the install process will try
 again on Chinese mirrors if the Google central download repo is not
 available.  Since the zipball is checked against the embedded SHA1 checksum,
 the install will fail if the mirror contains a corrupted version.

 horst is a small, lightweight IEEE802.11 wireless LAN analyzer with a
 text interface. Its basic function is similar to tcpdump, Wireshark
 or Kismet, but it's much smaller and shows different, aggregated
 information which is not easily available from other tools. It is
 mainly targeted at debugging wireless LANs with a focus on ad-hoc
 (IBSS) mode in larger mesh networks. It can be useful to get a quick
 overview of what is happening on all wireless LAN channels and to
 identify problems.
 .
  * Shows signal/noise values per station
  * Calculates channel utilization ("usage") by adding up the amount
 of time the packets actually occupy the medium
  * "Spectrum Analyzer" shows signal levels and usage per channel
 Graphical packet history, with signal/noise, packet type and physical
 rate
  * Shows all stations per ESSID and the live TSF per node as it is
 counting
  * Detects IBSS "splits" (same ESSID but different BSSID \u2013 this
 is a common driver problem)
  * Statistics of packets/bytes per physical rate and per packet type
  * Has some support for mesh protocols (OLSR and batman)
  * Can filter specific packet types source addresses or BSSIDs
  * Client/server support for monitoring on remote nodes

Description-en: Python module to access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API
 PyCUDA lets you access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API from Python.
 Several wrappers of the CUDA API already exist–so what’s so special about
 PyCUDA?
  * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called
    RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free
    code.  PyCUDA knows about dependencies, too, so (for example) it won’t
    detach from a context before all memory allocated in it is also freed.
  * Convenience. Abstractions like pycuda.driver.SourceModule and
    pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray make CUDA programming even more convenient than
    with Nvidia’s C-based runtime.
  * Completeness. PyCUDA puts the full power of CUDA’s driver API at your
    disposal, if you wish.
  * Automatic Error Checking. All CUDA errors are automatically translated
    into Python exceptions.

 Repo is a repository management tool that the Android developers built on top
 of Git. Repo unifies the many Git repositories when necessary, does the
 uploads to the Android revision control system, and automates parts of the
 Android development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make
 it easier to work with Git in the context of Android. The repo command is an
 executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path. In working
 with the Android source files, you will use Repo for across-network
 operations. For example, with a single Repo command you can download files
 from multiple repositories into your local working directory.
 .
 repo is an unusual tool because it downloads all of its own Python modules
 using GPG-signed git tags, and stores those files as part of the project that
 it is working with.  So this package just provides the wrapper script, which
 provides the GPG signing keys for verifying that the correct Python code was
 downloaded.

Description-md5: a7034f989f1ae2e40b4db1b5bb58bd47
Description-en: Task scheduler for heterogeneous multicore machines
 StarPU is a runtime system that offers support for heterogeneous
 multicore machines. While many efforts are devoted to design efficient
 computation kernels for those architectures (e.g. to implement BLAS
 kernels on GPUs or on Cell's SPUs), StarPU not only takes care of
 offloading such kernels (and implementing data coherency across
 the machine), but it also makes sure the kernels are executed as
 efficiently as possible.
 .
 This package contains MPI extensions for StarPU.

Package: sugar-etoys-activity
Description-md5: 7c0b74a2bdb91dff8c1caed94e5f5bfb
Description-en: Etoys activity for Sugar Learning Platform
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
 packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
 instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
 Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
 be invited to join a collective Activity session.
 .
 Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and
 starLOGO. It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple,
 powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by
 end-users. It includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles,
 presentations, web-pages, videos, sound and MIDI, etc. It includes the
 ability to share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so many
 forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet.
 .
 The Etoys activity embeds Squeak Etoys into Sugar.
