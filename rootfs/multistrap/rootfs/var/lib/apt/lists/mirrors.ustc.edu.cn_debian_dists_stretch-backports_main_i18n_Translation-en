Package: acmetool
Description-md5: 3e5e145ae880b97f3b6e825daf35ce32
Description-en: automatic certificate acquisition tool for Let's Encrypt
 acmetool is an easy-to-use command line tool for automatically
 acquiring TLS certificates from ACME (Automated Certificate Management
 Environment) servers such as Let's Encrypt, designed to flexibly
 integrate into your webserver setup to enable automatic verification.
 .
 acmetool is designed to work like make: you specify what certificates
 you want, and acmetool obtains certificates as necessary to satisfy
 those requirements. If the requirements are already satisfied,
 acmetool doesn't do anything when invoked. Thus, acmetool is
 ideally suited for use on a cron job; it will do nothing until
 certificates are near expiry, and then obtain new ones.
 .
 acmetool is designed to minimise the use of state and be transparent
 in the state that it does use. All state, including certificates, is
 stored in a single directory, by default /var/lib/acme. The schema
 for this directory is simple, comprehensible and documented.

Package: biboumi
Description-md5: 479d7434bd03973bbda4b1be59f8e98d
Description-en: XMPP gateway to connect to IRC servers
 Biboumi is an XMPP gateway that connects to IRC servers and translates
 between the two protocols. It can be used to access IRC channels using
 any XMPP client as if these channels were XMPP MUCs.
 .
 It is written in modern C++14 and makes great efforts to have as little
 dependencies and to be as simple as possible.
 .
 The goal is to provide a way to access most of IRC features using any
 XMPP client.  It doesn’t however try to provide a complete mapping of
 the features of both worlds simply because this is not useful and most
 probably impossible.  For example all IRC modes are not all
 translatable into an XMPP features.  Some of them are (like +m (mute)
 or +o (operator) modes), but some others are IRC-specific.  If IRC is
 the limiting factor (for example you cannot have a non-ASCII nickname
 on IRC) then biboumi doesn’t try to work around this issue: it just
 enforces the rules of the IRC server by telling the user that he/she
 must choose an ASCII-only nickname.  An important goal is to keep the
 software (and its code) light and simple.

 it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
 in which all information and all control elements are available.

 some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
 a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
 with their accustomed principle for setting and choosing a screen
 saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
 again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
 the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by

Package: borgbackup
Description-md5: 8a56876615c13f6f25a373ef5d5c2017
Description-en: deduplicating and compressing backup program
 Borg is a deduplicating and compressing backup program. Optionally, it
 also supports authenticated encryption. It was forked from the attic
 backup program.
 .
 The main goal of Borg is to provide an efficient and secure way to
 backup data. The data deduplication technique used makes Borg suitable
 for daily backups since only the changes are stored. The authenticated
 encryption makes it suitable for backups to not fully trusted targets.
 .
 It can push backups to remote repositories accessed via ssh. A client
 pushing a backup invokes "borg serve" on the repository host. It is
 possible to restrict the ssh key to "borg serve" using the
 authorized_keys command= clause.
 .
 Please note that the server and the client should be on the same
 version of borgbackup. Using different versions of borgbackup on
 client and server might result in 'incompatible API version' error
 messages and a non-working backup.
 .
 While there is no direct operations mode for pull-type backups, you
 can configure the backup target in append-only mode, preventing the
 backup source from deleting or altering previous backups.

Package: certspotter
Description-md5: dcd7ea2910639d061748abb8f430bfd1
Description-en: Certificate Transparency Log Monitor
 Cert Spotter is a Certificate Transparency log monitor from SSLMate that
 alerts you when a SSL/TLS certificate is issued for one of your domains.
 Cert Spotter is easier than other open source CT monitors, since it does
 not require a database. It's also more robust, since it uses a special
 certificate parser that ensures it won't miss certificates.
 .
 Cert Spotter is also available as a hosted service by SSLMate,
 <https://sslmate.com/certspotter>
 .
 You can use Cert Spotter to detect:
  * Certificates issued to attackers who have compromised a certificate
    authority and want to impersonate your site.
  * Certificates issued to attackers who are using your infrastructure
    to serve malware.
  * Certificates issued in violation of your corporate policy
    or outside of your centralized certificate procurement process.
  * Certificates issued to your infrastructure providers without your
    consent.

 system by using dpkg-divert on configuration files.  These modules
 attempt to make the process of creating configuration packages
 efficient by checking the md5sums of upstream configuration files
 that are to be modified and automatically generating the relevant
 postinst code to perform the diversions using the standard debhelper
 mechanism.  In addition to a debhelper command and sequencer extension
 module, CDBS modules are also included, but future development will
 focus on the debhelper interface.

Description-md5: 9bb162e0cc542877672e43a15da10cd8
Description-en: virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers
 Darktable manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view
 them  through a zoomable lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw
 images and enhance them.
 .
 It tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free
 raw converters and image management tools (such as ufraw or f-spot).
 The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and
 mipmaps, all stored in a database. the user will always be able to interact,
 even if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.
 .
 All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image
 buffers for display. the full image is only converted during export. The
 frontend is written in gtk+/cairo, the database uses sqlite3, raw image
 loading is done using rawspeed, high-dynamic range, and standard image formats
 such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates completely on floating
 point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for
 scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).

Package: dh-linktree
Description-md5: 7ef44f371b55fb620fe2ec953830eab4
Description-en: Create symlink trees within a Debian package
 Many developers bundle PHP or JavaScript libraries in the software that
 they provide. The Debian packager must then replace those "embedded copies"
 with symlinks to the packaged copy of those files. This operation is not
 without risks. A version mismatch can be the source of bugs that are hard to
 track.
 .
 dh_linktree is a tool that can assist you in this task. It can either
 unconditionally install a symlink tree of a given directory at the place
 of your choice, or it can only replace existing files with symlinks, or it
 can only replace existing identical files with symlinks.

Description-md5: f67fcf10a6b64596823a4d0c9e28aa06
Description-en: execute shell commands via XMPP (dangerous!)
 WARNING: USE THIS MODULE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!
 This module allows ejabberd administrators to remotely execute shell commands
 which could compromise both the ejabberd server and the whole machine.
 .
 This module provides the ejabberd server administrator a method to remotely
 execute shell commands through the ejabberd server.
 .
 It provides a page in the ejabberd Web Admin which only the administrators of
 the whole server can access.
 .
 Three types of commands are possible:
  * ejabberd_ctl: makes a call to ejabberd_ctl;
  * erlang shell: executes an erlang command;
  * system shell: executes a command on the system shell.
 The result of the execution will be shown.
 .
 In the system shell, only non-interactive commands will work correctly,
 for example this will work:
  ps -all
 Don't use commands that start an interactive mode:
 DON'T TRY THIS: top
 DON'T TRY THIS: vim readme.txt
 .
 This module does not check if the commands are dangerous or problematic,
 so this module is only recommended for experienced ejabberd and Erlang/OTP
 administrators. USE THIS MODULE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!

Description-en: Erlang/Elixir XMPP parsing and serialization library
 This library provides comprehensive representation of XMPP elements as
 well as tools to work with them. Every such element is represented by an
 Erlang record. Most of the library's code is auto generated and thus
 considered to be bug free and efficient.
 .
 The approach is very similar to ASN.1, Google Protocol Buffers or Apache
 Thrift: an XML element is transformed into internal language structure
 (an Erlang record in this case) - the process known as "decoding". During
 decoding, validation is also performed, thus well-typed structures are
 generated, potentially decreasing bugs related to handcrafted parsing. A
 reverse process known as "encoding" is applied for transforming an
 Erlang record into an XML element.
 .
 This package should be used along with erlang-p1-xml, because it is
 only able to decode from and encode to structures generated by that
 library (that is, xmlel() elements).

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

 This package provides two modules for integration with Emacs:
 .
  * git.el:
 .
    Status manager that displays the state of all the files of the
    project and provides easy access to the most frequently used git
    commands. The user interface is intended to be similar to the
    pcl-cvs mode. It can be started with `M-x git-status'.
 .
  * git-blame.el:
 .
    Emacs implementation of incremental "git blame".  When you turn it
    on while viewing a file, the editor buffer will be updated by
    setting the background of individual lines to a color that reflects
    which commit it comes from.
 .

Description-md5: 606237586cd533eed7972349938eab1e
Description-en: HTTP request pipeline suitable for use across multiple go-routines
 Package autorest implements an HTTP request pipeline suitable for use across
 multiple go-routines and provides the shared routines relied on by AutoRest
 (see https://github.com/Azure/autorest/) generated Go code.
 .
 The package breaks sending and responding to HTTP requests into three phases:
 Preparing, Sending, and Responding.
 .
 Each phase relies on decorators to modify and / or manage processing.
 Decorators may first modify and then pass the data along, pass the data first
 and then modify the result, or wrap themselves around passing the data (such as
 a logger might do). Decorators run in the order provided.
 .
 Preparers and Responders may be shared and re-used (assuming the underlying
 decorators support sharing and re-use). Performant use is obtained by creating
 one or more Preparers and Responders shared among multiple go-routines, and a
 single Sender shared among multiple sending go-routines, all bound together by
 means of input / output channels.
 .
 Decorators hold their passed state within a closure (such as the path
 components in the example above). Be careful to share Preparers and Responders
 only in a context where such held state applies. For example, it may not make
 sense to share a Preparer that applies a query string from a fixed set of
 values. Similarly, sharing a Responder that reads the response body into a
 passed struct (e.g., ByUnmarshallingJson) is likely incorrect.
 .
 Lastly, the Swagger specification (https://swagger.io) that drives AutoRest
 (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/) precisely defines two date forms: date and
 date-time. The github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/date package provides
 time.Time derivations to ensure correct parsing and formatting.
 .
 Errors raised by autorest objects and methods will conform to the
 autorest.Error interface.

 The primary features of cmp are:
  * When the default behavior of equality does not suit the needs of the test,
    custom equality functions can override the equality operation.  For
    example, an equality function may report floats as equal so long as they
    are within some tolerance of each other.
  * Types that have an Equal method may use that method to determine equality.
    This allows package authors to determine the equality operation for the
    types that they define.
  * If no custom equality functions are used and no Equal method is defined,
    equality is determined by recursively comparing the primitive kinds on both
    values, much like reflect.DeepEqual. Unlike reflect.DeepEqual, unexported
    fields are not compared by default; they result in panics unless suppressed
    by using an Ignore option (see cmpopts.IgnoreUnexported) or explicitly
    compared using the AllowUnexported option.
 .

Package: golang-github-hashicorp-memberlist-dev
Description-md5: b875e52b0f5b6e3a76d700941fa09b3e
Description-en: Golang package for gossip based membership and failure detection
 memberlist is a Go library that manages cluster membership and member failure
 detection using a gossip based protocol.
 .
 The use cases for such a library are far-reaching: all distributed systems
 require membership, and memberlist is a re-usable solution to managing cluster
 membership and node failure detection.
 .
 memberlist is eventually consistent but converges quickly on average. The speed
 at which it converges can be heavily tuned via various knobs on the protocol.
 Node failures are detected and network partitions are partially tolerated by
 attempting to communicate to potentially dead nodes through multiple routes.

 connections your Go frontend servers have inbound, and how big are the
 connection pools to your backends. You should also be able to inspect
 your connection without ssh and netstat.

 .
 Conventions:
   Control messages like SYN/FIN/RST in TCP are not defined in KCP.
   You need some keepalive/heartbeat mechanims in the application-level.
   A real world example is to use some multiplexing protocol over session,
   such as smux (golang-github-xtaci-smux-dev) with embedded keepalive
   mechanism. See kcptun (https://github.com/xtaci/kcptun) for example.

Description-en: caching, DNSSEC-validating DNS resolver
 The Knot DNS Resolver is a caching full resolver implementation
 written in C and LuaJIT, including both a resolver library and a
 daemon. Modular architecture of the library keeps the core tiny and
 efficient, and provides a state-machine like API for
 extensions. There are three built-in modules - iterator, cache,
 validator, and many external.
 .
 The Lua modules, switchable and shareable cache, and fast FFI
 bindings makes it great to tap into resolution process, or be used
 for your recursive DNS service. It's the OpenResty of DNS.
 .
 The server adopts a different scaling strategy than the rest of the
 DNS recursors - no threading, shared-nothing architecture (except
 MVCC cache that may be shared). You can start and stop additional
 nodes depending on the contention without downtime.

 Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and more.
 .
 Lazarus is the missing part of the puzzle that will allow you to develop
 programs for all of the above platforms in a Delphi-like environment.
 The IDE is a RAD tool that includes a form designer.
 .
 Unlike Java's "write once, run anywhere" motto, Lazarus and Free Pascal
 strive for "write once, compile anywhere". Since the exact same compiler
 is available on all of the above platforms you don't need to do any recoding
 to produce identical products for different platforms.
 .
 In short, Lazarus is a free RAD tool for Free Pascal using its Lazarus
 Component Library (LCL).
 .
 This dependency package always depends on the latest available version of
 the package containing common components.

Description-en: Reliable Event Logging Protocol (RELP) library - development files
 RELP provides reliable event logging over the network.
 .
 RELP (and hence) librelp assures that no message is lost, not even when
 connections break and a peer becomes unavailable. The current version of
 RELP has a minimal window of opportunity for message duplication after a
 session has been broken due to network problems. In this case, a few messages
 may be duplicated (a problem that also exists with plain tcp syslog). Future
 versions of RELP will address this shortcoming.
 .
 Please note that RELP is a general-purpose, extensible logging protocol. Even
 though it was designed to solve the urgent need of rsyslog-to-rsyslog
 communication, RELP supports many more applications. Extensible command verbs
 provide ample opportunity to extend the protocol without affecting existing
 applications.

Package: lime-forensics-dkms
Description-md5: cb370b8d5216a7ee6a5025cd0a804f1f
Description-en: kernel module to memory dump (DKMS)
 LiME (Linux Memory Extractor, formerly DMD) is a Loadable Kernel
 Module (LKM), which allows the acquisition of volatile memory (RAM)
 from Linux and Linux-based devices, such as those powered by Android.
 In others words, you can use it to get a memory image from a machine.
 .
 The tool supports acquiring memory either to the file system of the
 device or over the network. LiME is unique in that it is the first
 tool that allows full memory captures from Android devices. It also
 minimizes its interaction between user and kernel space processes
 during acquisition. It will produce memory captures that are more
 forensically sound than those of other tools designed for Linux
 memory acquisition. The dump format provided as "lime" is fully
 compatible with volatility framework.
 .
 This package provides the source code for the lime-forensics kernel
 modules to be build with dkms.
 .
 Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

Package: lintian
Description-md5: ea0553cc9ee5ab9a0505303638c060d4
Description-en: Debian package checker
 Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
 violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
 policy as well as some checks for common errors.
 .
 It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores
 information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This makes it possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 4.1.3.

 LyX is an almost WYSIWYG-frontend for LaTeX. It makes the power and
 typesetting quality of LaTeX available for people who are used to
 word processors. Since LyX supports LaTeX's concept of general
 mark-ups, it is even easier and faster to create professional quality
 documents with it than with usual word processors. It is also
 possible to use LaTeX commands within LyX, so nothing of LaTeX's
 power is lost.
 .
 You can extend the functionality of LyX by installing these packages:
  * chktex: check for typographical errors
  * gnuhtml2latex: import HTML documents
  * groff: improved table formatting in plain text exports
  * librsvg2-bin, inkscape: use the SVG image format in LyX documents

Package: mksh
Description-md5: 2809d412e12a286f105f3183079fee7e
Description-en: MirBSD Korn Shell
 mksh is the successor of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh),
 a Bourne/POSIX compatible shell which is largely similar to the
 original AT&T Korn Shell (ksh88/ksh93).
 It includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a
 modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
 mksh has UTF-8 support (in string operations and the Emacs editing
 mode). The code has been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed,
 standards compliance added, and several enhancements (for extended
 compatibility to other modern shells, as well as a couple of its
 own) are available.
 This shell is Debian Policy 10.4 compliant and works as /bin/sh on
 Debian systems (use the /bin/lksh executable) and is a good rescue
 and initrd shell (consider the /bin/mksh-static executable).
 .
 The mksh binary is a complete, full-featured shell. It provides a
 “consistent across all platforms” guarantee, using 32-bit integers
 for arithmetics, possibly deviating from POSIX.
 .
 The mksh-static binary is a version of mksh, linked against klibc,
 musl, or dietlibc (if they exist for that Debian architecture and
 are usable) and optimised for small code size, for example for use
 on initrd or initramfs images, installation or rescue systems.
 Except for omitting some features to be smaller, it is similar to
 the mksh binary otherwise. Note the exact feature set may differ
 depending on which C library was used to compile it.
 .
 The lksh binary is a script shell based on mksh intended to run old
 ksh88 and pdksh scripts, but not for interactive use. When used as
 /bin/sh it follows POSIX most closely, including use of the host’s
 “long” C data type for arithmetics. It also contains kludges so it
 can run as /bin/sh on Debian beyond what Policy dictates, to work
 around bugs in maintainer scripts and LSB init scripts shipped by
 many packages, such as including a rudimentary printf(1) builtin,
 permitting a shell function to be named stop overriding the default
 alias, more loose interpretation of shell extglobs, etc.
 .
 A sample ~/.mkshrc is included in /usr/share/doc/mksh/examples and
 provided as /etc/mkshrc conffile, which is sourced by another file
 /etc/skel/.mkshrc users are recommended to copy into their home.
 .

Description-en: Tighten web applications security for Apache
 Modsecurity is an Apache module whose purpose is to tighten the Web
 application security. Effectively, it is an intrusion detection and prevention
 system for the web server.
 .
 At the moment its main features are:
   * Audit log; store full request details in a separate file, including POST
     payloads.
   * Request filtering; incoming requests can be analysed and offensive requests
     can be rejected (or simply logged, if that is what you want). This feature
     can be used to prevent many types of attacks (e.g. XSS attacks, SQL
     injection, ...) and even allow you to run insecure applications on your
     servers (if you have no other choice, of course).

 mwclient is a lightweight Python client library to the MediaWiki API
 which provides access to most API functionality. It works with Python
 2.7, 3.3 and above, and supports MediaWiki 1.16 and above. For
 functions not available in the current MediaWiki, a
 MediaWikiVersionError is raised.
 .
 Most properties and generators accept the same parameters as the API,
 without their two-letter prefix. Exceptions to this rule:
 .
  * Image.imageinfo is the imageinfo of the latest image. Earlier
    versions can be fetched using imagehistory()
  * Site.all*: parameter  [ap]from renamed to start
  * categorymembers is implemented as Category.members
  * deletedrevs is deletedrevisions
  * usercontribs is usercontributions
  * First parameters of search and usercontributions are search and
    user respectively
 .
 Properties and generators are implemented as Python generators. Their
 limit parameter is only an indication of the number of items in one
 chunk. It is not the total limit. Doing list(generator(limit =
 limit)) will return ALL items of generator, and not be limited by the
 limit value. Default chunk size is generally the maximum chunk size.

 systems are:
 .
  * A multi-dimensional data model (timeseries defined by metric name and set
    of key/value dimensions).
  * A flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality.
  * No dependency on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous.
  * Timeseries collection happens via a pull model over HTTP.
  * Pushing timeseries is supported via an intermediary gateway.
  * Targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration.
  * Multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support.
  * Federation support coming soon.

Package: python-pycryptodome
Description-md5: 298f0a0583489a3c2e3c15eb3b38b36d
Description-en: cryptographic Python library (Python 2)
 PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level
 cryptographic primitives.
 .
 PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto. It brings several enhancements
 with respect to the last official version of PyCrypto (2.6.1),
 for instance:
 .
   * Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX, SIV, OCB)
   * Accelerated AES on Intel platforms via AES-NI
   * First class support for PyPy
   * Elliptic curves cryptography (NIST P-256 curve only)
   * Better and more compact API (`nonce` and `iv` attributes for ciphers,
     automatic generation of random nonces and IVs, simplified CTR cipher mode,
     and more)
   * SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs) and BLAKE2 hash algorithms
   * Salsa20 and ChaCha20 stream ciphers
   * scrypt and HKDF
   * Deterministic (EC)DSA
   * Password-protected PKCS#8 key containers
   * Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme
   * Random numbers get sourced directly from the OS (and not from a CSPRNG in
     userspace)
   * Simplified install process, including better support for Windows
   * Cleaner RSA and DSA key generation (largely based on FIPS 186-4)
   * Major clean ups and simplification of the code base
 .
 PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like *OpenSSL*.
 To the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python.
 Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers)
 are implemented as C extensions.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.

 This nagios compatible monitoring plugin will check available space and error
 statistics of a btrfs filesystem.
 .
 Traditional space usage monitoring based on the output of df is not sufficient
 when using btrfs. This plugin takes allocated but unused disk space, and
 unallocatable disk space (for example when mixing different sized disks with
 raid profiles) into account. It is meant to be used as an addition to using a
 regular disk usage plugin, based on df output.

 Additionally, the check keeps an eye on device error stats and will report if
 any of the counters (read errors, write errors, etc) of a device that is part
 of the filesystem is not zero.

 config format) specifies your chain of ETL steps. This chain is formed
 by a series of Python modules/objects and their parameters. These are
 symbolically specified in the config file. You just invoke etl.py the
 main program with a config file. The config file specifies the input
 modules (e.g. PostGIS), transformers (e.g. XSLT) and outputs (e.g. a GML

Package: r-cran-bit
Description-md5: 1f7319050aa1386ab244caabc922c084
Description-en: GNU R class for vectors of 1-bit booleans
 This GNU R package provides bitmapped vectors of booleans (no NAs),
 coercion from and to logicals, integers and integer subscripts; fast
 boolean operators and fast summary statistics. With 'bit' vectors you
 can store true binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the expense of 1 bit
 only, on a 32 bit architecture this means factor 32 less RAM and ~
 factor 32 more speed on boolean operations. Due to overhead of R calls,
 actual speed gain depends on the size of the vector: expect gains for
 vectors of size > 10000 elements. Even for one-time boolean operations
 it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is obvious, when such
 components are used more than once.
 .
 Reading from and writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing
 standard logicals - mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The
 package allows one to work with pre-allocated memory for return values
 by calling .Call() directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with
 pre-allocated vector memory, coping from bit to logical requires only
 70% of the time for copying from logical to logical; and copying from
 logical to bit comes at a performance penalty of 150%. the package now
 contains further classes for representing logical selections: 'bitwhich'
 for very skewed selections and 'ri' for selecting ranges of values for
 chunked processing. All three index classes can be used for subsetting
 'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).

 WARNING: do not use them as replacement for 32bit integers, integer64 are not
 supported for subscripting by R-core and they have different semantics when
 combined with double, e.g. integer64 + double => integer64.
 Class integer64 can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames.

 and holds a number of sessions, each of which may have a number of
 windows linked to it. Any number of clients may connect to a session,
 or the server may be controlled by issuing commands with tmux.
 Communication takes place through a socket, by default placed in /tmp.
 Moreover tmux provides a consistent and well-documented command
 interface, with the same syntax whether used interactively, as a key
 binding, or from the shell. It offers a choice of vim or Emacs key
 layouts.

Description-en: Tomcat native library using the Apache Portable Runtime
 Tomcat can use the Apache Portable Runtime to provide superior scalability,
 performance, and better integration with native server technologies.
 The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly portable library that is at the
 heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR has many uses, including access to
 advanced IO functionality (such as sendfile, epoll and OpenSSL), OS level
 functionality (random number generation, system status, etc), and native
 process handling (shared memory, NT pipes and Unix sockets).
 .
 These features allows making Tomcat a general purpose webserver, will
 enable much better integration with other native web technologies, and
 overall make Java much more viable as a full fledged webserver platform
 rather than simply a backend focused technology.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: libunsafe-fences-java
Description-md5: 3e083c35292e0d5cff750122e0fbd1f0
Description-en: wrapper library around the Java 8 fences API
 unsafe-fences is a very simple Java library that just provides a shim
 around the Java 8 Unsafe methods used for memory fencing.
 .
 In Java 8, three memory-ordering intrinsics were added to the
 sun.misc.Unsafe class: fullFence, storeFence, and loadFence.
 .
 The main goal of unsafe-fences is to allow code in Java 6 and 7
 to compile those calls with a provided boolean guard.
 .
 This is especially useful for projects like JRuby that support
 several JDK versions but it can be reused by other Java projects as
 well.

Package: volatility
Description-md5: 4b32ecafb8984d5447ca6fa3901e4281
Description-en: advanced memory forensics framework
 The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools for
 the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
 It is useful in forensics analysis. The extraction techniques are
 performed completely independent of the system being investigated but
 offer unprecedented visibility into the runtime state of the system.
 .
 Volatility supports memory dumps from all major 32- and 64-bit Windows
 versions and service packs. Whether your memory dump is in raw format,
 a Microsoft crash dump, hibernation file, or virtual machine snapshot,
 Volatility is able to work with it.
 .
 Linux memory dumps in raw or LiME format are supported too. There are
 several plugins for analyzing memory dumps from 32- and 64-bit Linux
 kernels and relevant distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE,
 RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Mandriva, etc.
 .
 Volatility also support several versions of Mac OSX memory dumps, both
 32- and 64-bit. Android phones with ARM processors are also supported.
 .
 These are some of the data that can be extracted from a memory image:
    - Image information (date, time, CPU count);
    - Running processes;
    - Open network sockets and connections;
    - OS kernel modules loaded;
    - Memory maps for each process;
    - Executables samples;
    - Command history;
    - Suspicious process mappings (i.e. injected code);
    - Passwords, as LM/NTLM hashes and LSA secrets;
    - Cached Truecrypt passphrases;
    - Others.
 .
