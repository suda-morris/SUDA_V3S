Frequently* Asked Questions (FAQ) for the dphys-swapfile project

* not really frequent, but that is what such files are called


Q: Why are you building an swap file script?

A: Because we want to get rid of the inflexibility of swap partitions


Q: Why not simply make an swap file by hand?

A: Because we want to dynamically resize fitting to RAM size, and also want
   automatic installation of our systems


Q: Why not simply mount from /etc/fstab?

A: Because we can not (re-)size/generate File until /var is mounted and need
   to do so before swapon, and at least under Debian (and most likely under
   many others) we can not insert our setup code in between them (both are in
   then same init.d script)


Q: Will this work on my $DISTRIBUTION?

A: The actual script should work with any Linux distribution. It auto-installs
   everything it needs. And can uninstall all of this, when called with
   "uninstall" as parameter. It has actually been tested under Debian Linux
   3.0 (woody) and 3.1 (sarge) and under Slackware 9.1 and 10.0, so it seems
   to be totally portable


Q: Why is this called dphys-swapfile
?
A: Departement of PHYSics - SWAP FILE script


Q: Where can I get code?

A: The current (read: in edit, sometimes not functional) from:
   http://neil.franklin.ch/Projects/dphys-swapfile/ or:
   http://neil.franklin.ch/Projects/dphys-swapfile.tar.gz or

   Various milestones/releases (read: archives, working) from:
